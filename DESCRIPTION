Description:
  'CBLAS' provides the C interface to 'BLAS'. Since 'CBLAS' does not be included in R.
  Therefore, we introduce 'RCBLAS' to R through 'Rcpp'.
  The 'RCBLAS' package can be used in linking other package required 'CBLAS' in 'Rcpp'.
  The C interface to 'BLAS' routines included by R are compiled and single precision
  routine is excluded out. The supported routines of 'BLAS' can be found at
  'https://github.com/Chingchuan-chen/RCBLAS/tree/master/src'.
  The files 'src/*.c' and 'src/*.f' are come from 'LAPACK-3.7.1'.
